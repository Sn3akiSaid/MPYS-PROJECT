*MSYS2 MinGW64 Terminal commands to start*
VIDEO 1 (Set up MinGW64 and download all needed packages)

pacman -Syu	#updates system

pacman -Su	#updates packages

pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain	#installs base development system, dependencies and toolchain

#for some reason the ucrt repository above did not include fortran, so you need to also install this after

pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc-fortran #This is the official installation from fortranwiki.org for msys2

#Note that this installs a folder ucrt64, and the gfortran is in ucrt64/bin not in the previous mingw
#This step is done in another tutorial, you need to add the bin folder to environment variable path

pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-python3-pip mingw-w64-x86_64-python3-setuptools 	#installs pip3 and setup tools

/mingw64/bin/pip3 install fortran-language-server	#install fortls, crucial for VSCode highlighting etc

pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-lapack	#the bane of my existence, installs lapack and blas automatically

pacman -S git unzip zsh vim	#installs git? at this point I'm doing EVERYTHING from the tutorial

VIDEO 2 (Very optional video, it's just setting up the themes and the way the MSYS2 command prompt look)

sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"	#installs zsh shell

#To close zsh shell "Ctrl+D" -sends you back to MSYS2 MinGW64 shell
#To open zsh shell in MSYS2 MinGW64 just type "zsh"

pwd	#shows your home directory where you installed MSYS2

vim -p .zshrc .oh-my-zsh/themes/agnoster.zsh-theme	#now as you type you can just press Tab and the terminal autofills, also this selects the theme

#when he opens the theme file he changes ZSH_THEME="robbyrussel" to ="agnoster" but you might see you can't rename anything, in order to do so press the "+" button and then you can.

#also to save the overwrite if working through the shell write :w and hit Enter

VIDDEO 3 (Setting up VSCode)

#important thing to note here is that since the video came out VSCode has had the shell setup options for the setting.json deprecated
#if you look from the comments the most recent one shows the right way to do it
#After you set it up, your settings should look like below, you can just copy and paste what I've written but changing the zsh.exe directory to your correct one
#Also if you do copy paste make sure the indentations are correct

"terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.windows": "Zsh",
    "terminal.integrated.profiles.windows": {

        "PowerShell": {
            "source": "PowerShell",
            "icon": "terminal-powershell"
        },
        "Command Prompt": {
            "path": [
                "${env:windir}\\Sysnative\\cmd.exe",
                "${env:windir}\\System32\\cmd.exe"
            ],
            "args": [],
            "icon": "terminal-cmd"
        },
        "Git Bash": {
            "source": "Git Bash"
        },
        "Zsh": {
            "path":["C:\\Fortran\\MSYS2\\usr\\bin\\zsh.exe"],
            "args":[
                "--login",
                "-i"
            ],
        }

#After saving this in settings.json, open a new terminal and it should be the zsh one
#also if you try which gfortran in your new integrated zsh terminal in vscode it might be missing the pathing and give an error, in that case do the following

export PATH=/mingw64/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:$PATH #put this in the integrated terminal to add /mingw64/bin 

which gfortran #try to see if it finds it now

echo 'export PATH=/mingw64/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.zshrc #if it does find it enter this to make the PATH change permanent


VIDEO 4 (Test c++ project)

#When you download the extension vscode might automatically ask you to install some more extensions that have been developed since the video came out, install them.
Once you create the Makefile you change the following

CXXFLAGS = -std=c++11 -g -O0 -Wall -Wextra -Wshadow -Wnon-virtual-dtor -pedantic

VIDEO 5 (FINALLY FORTRAN)
#At the beginning of the video he installs breakpoint and intellisense extensions, do not install those, both are supported in the Modern Fortran extension


# Compiler settings - Can be customized.
CC = gfortran
CPP = gfortran -cpp
CXXFLAGS = -g -O0 -Wall -Wextra -Wshadow -pedantic
LDFLAGS = 

# Makefile settings - Can be customized.
APPNAME = myapp
EXT = .f90
SRCDIR = src
OBJDIR = obj


#Now because the extensions he installed do not have the same options as Modern Fortran extension, you'll need to look for the "Fortran>Linter:Compiler Path setting and put your fortls.exe path there

#Also because of the previous reason you might not see a specific setting for the Compiler path, you will need to make it in the settings.json file by putting this in, obviously replace with your own directory

"fortran.linter.compilerPath": "C:\\Fortran\\MSYS2\\mingw64\\bin\\gfortran.exe",
